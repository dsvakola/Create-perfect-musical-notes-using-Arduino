# Create perfect musical notes using Arduino
In this project we will see that how to create a different types of musical notes using simple Arduino coding and circuit.
This circuit is very useful to create the musical notes from 1st octave to last octave of any musical instrument.
I have tested this circuit with all types of musical notes within the boundaries specified by the musical standards.
